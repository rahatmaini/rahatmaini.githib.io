      <p>With UIs getting more and more complex and layered (especially legacy UIs that get new features padded on, often with no design team overseeing the process), it can be difficult to make the experience an enjoyable one. A rethinking of the whole design to incorporate new features and ideas that have been added is not easy to do (and not a scalable approach). For portals that rely more on the "hunt-and-pick" method of interaction, where users know what they are looking for or what they want, just not where it is, a complex UI is a burden. Maybe a search function is a remedy in some cases. Discovery of new features and tools is not really the focus of these UIs, making the already well-known features accessible and available is. I cannot think of a better application for a chatbot user interface than a complicated UI in need of human-centric design.</p>

      <img src="images/SIS chatbot/SISchatbot.png" width="30%" height="30%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>Chatbots and conversational UIs have been invading our lives recently, whether in the form of a voice assistant on your phone, a chatbot in a messaging app, or the Alexa in your home. It's trendy, but rarely applied the best way it can be. In this case, it is a perfect user interface. Most of the tasks performed in a student information system (getting grades, finance information, transcripts, signing up for classes) can be easily explained by a natural language query. In such a system, there are no menus, submenus, buttons, or any of that mess. The user knows what they would like done, and they instruct their application to do so, naturally.</p>

      <p>In the above mockup, you may notice a few things. The only real buttons are suggestions for additional queries, likely AI powered to know what users usually request next or what might be the next logical task or information in the system to retrieve at that moment. Also at the bottom you may notice the "hey lou" voice wake word, should the user want to use speech to interact with the bot (affectionately named Lou, a 1 in 49581 people name, easy to enter the vernacular of a school to refer to the application exclusively). The rest of the mockup is self-explanatory, and it is easy to imagine further applications of this kind of UI and the use cases it enables.</p>

      <button class="collapsible"><h2>The Case for a Side-Scrolling UI</h2></button>
      <div class="content">
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/courses.png" width="70%" height="70%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>Making a webpage with limited content/UI is always a challenge in the sense that too much whitespace looks unsightly. This limited content may be a massive list you have to scroll through (in this case), but limited by the small amount of data expressed for each list item. How do you make a pleasing UI where all you have to do is scroll through a list and select an item? This is of course easily doable for screen sizes such as a phone perhaps, but when your core audience is people viewing your content through a widescreen Chrome window, this becomes very difficult.</p>

      <p>
      The norm is to have lists be vertically scrolling, of course. This makes a ton of sense when your content is heavily horizontal spanning. That way, the maximum screen real estate can be utilized. In this situation however, I had to work with text-only data points that don't quite take up much space. As you can see, there are only 4 distinct text boxes per element in the list to be scrolled. Having this scroll vertically would be a tremendous waste of horizontal. It's clear that horizontally scrolling would be the way to go, but what is the best way to take advantage of all that new gained vertical space per element?
      </p>

      <p>
        Iconography and its effect on easing cognitive load for processing data needs no explanation. It was clear that for better comprehension of the data as well as a aesthetically appealing look, icons would have to be employed. In this case, I opted for line-drawn icons instead of filled icons, for aesthetics and the discomfort I feel when seeing a filled icon that is not a button of some sort. Optimal padding is present, to give each data point ample breathing room (and to liberally use all that vertical space). The use of shadows helps establish depth and layers to the page, and of course typography establishes hierarchy (large font size for the title of the page, small but bold for the card title, and regular and smaller for each data point in the cards).
      </p>

      <p>
        The moral of the story is that side scrolling is a fantastic tool in the utility kit for a web designer, one that is criminally underused perhaps since people are not used to it or that scrollwheel mice are physically designed to scroll vertically (however many people still using those, but hey that might be your core audience). Especially in a situation like this, horizontal scrolling is an efficient use of screen real estate and looks fantastic.

      <button class="collapsible"><h2>Redesigning a Classroom Observation Portal</h2></button>
      <div class="content">
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/transform.png" width="100%" height="100%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>Redesigning a user interface is a daunting task. You have to consider your users, the current interface's many functions, and the end goal of your
      redesign as well as the original goal of the project you are redesigning. Often times more than just a facelift, such projects require understanding
      of interaction design. My first step is usually writing down each necessary element of the original design (page title, each checkbox element, 
      submit/reset buttons, etc) and then clear my head of the design, and try and logically develop a new one, from the perspective of a user trying
      to complete each task possible with the current design. Here is how I proceeded.</p>
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/oldDesign.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" class="centeredImg"/>
      
      <p>From the start, you notice a few things. First, there's a lot of archaic acronyms! This is generally ok if you're audience is specially trained to be able to understand the acronyms and use the software. However, it arguably lessens cognitive load on the user when they don't have to recall acronyms which is why I opted to use natural language instead of acronyms. Second, there's lot's of unused space. You notice the feedback section, whose purpose is to report all user input so the user can verify their actions are being submitted. A better solution was to relegate the entire section to a feed modal button, and instead provide realtime subtle notifications whenever an action is performed (shown below, excuse the lack of padding in the design).
      </p>
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/notification.gif" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>

      <p>Currently the design employed an orange color across the page (not necessarily a theme, as there is no palette of primary and secondary colors). This was not necessary and did not do much for the stylistic aspect of the page. Instead, going with a monochromatic theme and opting to use color to emphasize elements of the UI was preferred. Such as a pulsing "start" button, where the color and animation both serve to draw attention to the initial action that must be performed on the page to proceed with anything (shown below).
      </p>
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/start.gif" width="20%" height="20%" class="centeredImg"/>

      <p>
      The use of iconography is always appreciated. Generally a rule is that an icon should be able to completely replace the text that describes it, and understood in less time than it would take to read the text. However, icons can also be used as supplements, as seen here. Here, they are used to complete the sentences of the buttons they are embedded within. Also seen is an icon for a person, indicating the counter to the right of it is for the person count. A bit more elegant than "# of Students:".
      </p>
      <img src="images/classroomPortal/hover.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>

      <p>
      A lot goes into making an aesthetically appealing website. Drop shadows consistent in angle to emulate a stationary light source, depth to simulate spatial hierarchy, typography with varying weights and sizes to emphasize that hierarchy, iconography to ease understanding, and animations and colors to direct attention and bring liveliness to the page. It's a science that I am continously trying to understand, and a craft I am constantly working at. This is yet another attempt at understanding and working that science and craft, with much more to come.
