    <button class="collapsible"><h2>Exploring the Quip Electric Toothbrush</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
      <img src="images/quip/inhand.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>As the Internet of Things advances at a rapid rate parallel to the shrinkage of size and cost of the chips that make up our modern computing world, companies eagerly push out new products with often excessive engineering that proves to be purposeless or “smart” editions of their current product lineup. These products become the butt of jokes when engineers replace designers and you get intrusive software updates with unclear benefits to the user, confusing error messages, and security breaches for the simplest utilities such as… light switches. Compact, sleek, and strictly utilitarian, the Quip electric toothbrush represents a beautiful mix of form and function, balancing each with restraint where sensible, resulting in an object sufficiently more advanced than the one it effortlessly replaces.</p>
      <img src="images/quip/bristles.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>There is no denying that the Quip is a handsome device. The plastic versions of the brush are somewhat gaudy, however, coming in colors often reserved for bathroom slippers I’ve seen in 3rd world countries. The “Edition” edition (a gaffe also made by Apple once upon a time for the Apple Watch), the one I tested, sports the same anodized aluminum construction as the Metal editions of the brush. The finish is pleasing and immediately familiar to anyone who has used a MacBook or iPad in the past. Given the choice between medical grade stainless steel and anodized aluminum, I am elated that Quip chose the more stylish, colorizable material that is aluminum. However, the option of stainless steel (despite the unusual chrome look it would sport, as well as the glossy finish that would attract fingerprints) would be appreciated. For a brush designed to last a lifetime (with literal lifetime support as long as you subscribe to their 3 month bristle/battery refill plan), the durability of painted aluminum would be questionable if the nature of the product was to be employed in a more rugged environment. For a cylindrical tube that stays in your bathroom, I have no doubts about the durability and reliability of the enclosure, developed to be as water resistant as a toothbrush would need to be. </p>
      <img src="images/quip/paste.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>Each Quip brush comes with a rubber head with soft, end-rounded monochromatic bristles. No gimmicks of multicolored, different textured and sized bristles along the head. All there is to it is a uniform set of bristles, with a standard texturized tongue cleaner on the back. The choice to go with rubber instead of plastic like many competitors is ingenious, giving the brush a more premium feel with the practicality of an elastic extension that doesn’t combat your teeth/gums by accident. The cute embossed Quip logo on the tongue cleaner (the only part of the brush where the brand is explicitly spelled out) is appreciative instead of a blazenly printed logo somewhere else. The only other branding on the brush is the “Q” mark, acting as the “activate” button. With the All-Black Metal Edition, the bristles are also black (and as hoped but somehow not obviously expected, the refill bristles will also always be black). These black bristles immediately distinguish the Quip from other brushes, while serving the undiscovered purpose of revealing where toothpaste is left over (as you’ll see if you should use this, a LOT of toothpaste gets left in the base of the bristles). The black bristles contrast perfectly and elegantly against standard white toothpaste. As bristles should be, these are soft rather than the medium or hard type that are unnecessarily abrasive to gums. Swapping out bristles could not be more intuitive, applying force snaps them back and off the body, no instructions needed.
</p>
      <img src="images/quip/onmirror.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>The travel cover mirror mount is somewhat of a miracle to use. Despite plastic construction (jarring for the aluminum constructed toothbrushes), it is color matched to the brush head, giving the appearance of a positively monolithic product should you dock the brush with the bristles out. The more hygienic arrangement, with the bristles in, results in a two tone display of either black or white cover and the colored body of the brush. The real magic is how the suction “strip” on the back of the cover, seems to work. With no cup to create a partial vacuum and seemingly no actual adhesive that I could sense (or one that if it were to exist, has definitely faded away after rolling around in my backpack daily), I actually don’t know how the cover mounts itself to a mirror. My best guess would’ve been micro suction cups embedded in the strip, but my naked eye does not see any and I find it hard to believe a toothbrush startup put research and development dollars into making such an idea work instead of just using a regular suction cup. Regardless, the end result is invisible and beautiful, always a good indicator of thoughtful design. The “quip” logo is laser cut out of the plastic, though when not mounted it can easily be read as “dinb”, a mistake a friend of mine actually made when trying to identify my toothbrush. Embarrassing overthought to brand the mount this way, a stain on the otherwise wonderful design. The suction strip also serves as a sufficient, but not ideal, anti-roll mechanism to stop it from falling off your counter should you decide not to mount it. Another incredible detail is the hidden concave base of the mount, rather than being flat (which would introduce the possibility of being slightly uneven or just generally more prone to tipping). From the outside, the mount has a cylindrical base, but it is concaved out at the bottom, bringing the center of gravity of the mount up along the shaft, making it more resilient to falling over. Included is a small slit to allow for potential water drainage from the brush. Brilliant.</p>
      <img src="images/quip/bottomofcase.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>There is no app for the Quip toothbrush, no cloud service, no Bluetooth or WiFi chip inside, and definitely no nightly wired charging needed. Such restraint has allowed for renewed focus on the actual brushing experience, where getting the proper 2 minutes of brushing time matters most. Having nailed the industrial design, Quip moves on and introduces a single button that activates the timer. Every 30 seconds, the vibrations briefly stop to indicate you should move onto another quadrant of your mouth. 4 quadrants, 30 seconds of brushing time each, 2 minutes total. No light indicators, no sounds, nothing but using the actual mechanism by which the electric brush operates to signify a change in state. This kind of human factors thinking seems simple yet is unprecedented in the smart toothbrush industry. Instead of a clumsy charging dock, you get a AAA battery that slides out easily from the brush and lasts 3 months. Everything about the electronic aspects of the Quip screams “less is more”, a quality amplified by its nonchalant industrial design.
      </p>
      <img src="images/quip/explodedview.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>Other than the hardware, the other big component and differentiator of Quip is the refill plan. After paying the initial price of entry (starting at $25) into Quip for the brush itself, you have the option of receiving a refill pack every 3 months for $5, containing new bristles and a very sleek looking Quip branded AAA battery (the attention to detail and control over every aspect of their product is astounding. Quip even prefers you use their own toothpaste). 3 months is the dentist recommended duration for keeping a toothbrush, so essentially after the buy in price, you’re paying $5 for a new electric toothbrush every 3 months, delivered to your doorstep. This is as financially sound as a smart toothbrush can possibly get. Cancellable at any time, no hidden fees, and no shipping costs, Quip’s business model is transparent, honest, and simple. It’s rare to see a startup have their business logistics so well sorted. One time purchases can be made for heads, AAA battery, or toothpaste (mint and watermelon) as well. No complaints here in the slightest.
      </p>
      <img src="images/quip/instand.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
      <p>In a world of Sonicares and $150 Colgate Smart Brushes that needlessly track metrics like tooth coverage, and sport 4 different modes and buttons and switches, Quip stands head and shoulders above the others with a fine balance between price, functionality, design, and utility. It’s quieter, thinner, lighter, more stylish, more affordable and accessible, and well thought out than the other guys. It’s more everything, and is so by being LESS of everything. If you’ve been around someone brushing with a Philips Sonicare, you’d know. It’s overwhelmingly bulky and surprisingly loud. Using a Quip is about as discreet as any other standard toothbrush on the market. There is no button marked “ON”, no switch, no charging port, or gimmicky branding. At the end of the day, Quip is not a gadget and this is its biggest strength. Backed by a lucrative and trendy subscription model that actually economically makes sense, Quip nails the essentials and goes above and beyond to comfortably be the only toothbrush you would need for the rest of your life. I could go on and on about how the packaging of the Quip made for such a pleasant first experience that percolates into my most recent experience with it an hour ago. I could rave about the wonderful online experience that made it so easy to get a Quip in my hands and new bristles on it every 3 months. But the fact that an electric toothbrush boasting the sensible features that this one does appears so regular while still being gorgeous speaks volumes to what Quip has achieved, is the highest compliment I can pay to the product that best represents the future of daily dental hygiene.

    <button class="collapsible"><h2>Xbox, Reboot</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
    
    <img src="images/xbox/xbox.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Since the introduction of the Xbox One in 2013, Microsoft’s gaming division has been on rocky footing, only recently getting itself together with the promotion of Phil Spencer to the Head of Xbox. Still, its hardware sales pale in comparison to the competition, its library of exclusives falters (purchasing a handful of game studios should help this), and initiatives in PC gaming/upending Steam are seemingly going nowhere. Fortunately, the world’s most valuable company (as of 2/18/19) has all the right pieces in place to write the next chapter in the history of gaming.</p>

    <img src="images/xbox/mattrick.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>It’s no secret that the Xbox One hardware lineup has been a comparative dud. Yes, tens of millions of them are sold and are in active use, but those numbers are easily eclipsed by the PS4 (on its way to 100 million devices sold) and the rapidly selling Nintendo Switch. Launched initially as a home entertainment device meant to control your entire TV experience and play high quality AAA games, Microsoft’s vision for the Xbox One went beyond just a hardware upgrade of their previous console. Unfortunately, the world just wasn’t ready for an always on microphone and camera sitting in their living rooms (had they been, perhaps Microsoft would’ve stumbled upon something similar yet even more advanced than the home voice assistants we are more comfortable with today). This is disappointing, but it was only ever the goal to sell volume in the beginning. As it became clear their $499 box was not ready for acceptance by the masses, the goalposts shifted. Today, Microsoft reports engagement statistics in their quarterly earnings, rather than units sold. This would either be a clear signifier that sales are abysmal, or what is more likely, that Xbox Live active users are what Microsoft prioritizes when measuring the success of its gaming platform. This would be a clear signifier that Microsoft is becoming hardware agnostic in its approach to conquering the gaming industry. News of new Xbox consoles in the works of course doesn’t quite corroborate that narrative, but I have the feeling that if they didn’t need to, Microsoft would’ve stopped making console hardware a while ago. As of today, the only place to play all Xbox One games is… an Xbox One. There is a robust ecosystem of accessories and devices around that console (and hopefully VR support coming soon), and Microsoft is not yet in the position to give that up. The $250 Xbox One S is the lowest common denominator for entry into the world of gaming as Microsoft is constructing it, and it must remain that way. Yet day by day, Microsoft’s actions indicate that the best place to game will not necessarily be some box produced by them, but you can be sure that it will be on their platform in some sense.</p>

    <img src="images/xbox/gamepass.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Xbox Game Pass has been compared to a sort of Netflix for gaming. Paying a flat rate per month for access to a catalog of 100+ games certainly sounds appealing, and it seems to point more to the future of this industry. Paying $60 to own a game is beginning to feel like purchasing a movie from iTunes or paying hundreds of dollars for a copy of Photoshop, or even $1.29 for a song. Subscription services are the future of software monetization. The actual economics of how publishers will sustain themselves when a user’s $10 per month must be divided amongst them all when in the past each pocketed all $60 are shaky to me, but I’m guessing an increase in volume will make up for that, and more engagement will lead to more microtransactions (unfortunately this is likely a trend that will continue in games). There is a reason Fortnite, a free to play game, is bringing in hundreds of millions in revenue for Epic. Game Pass is how Microsoft keeps customers on Xbox, and keeps them engaged. By promising all first party titles make their debut on the service, and these titles being exclusives, an audience is being built, and built to last. Game Pass is a piece of the larger puzzle, one that revolutionizes content distribution. With the recent release of Crackdown 3, many are drawing parallels to Netflix Originals and how the company freely experiments with its content, sometimes resulting in a dip in quality, but to no complaints. After all, it’s included in a subscription package you already pay for, rather than a separate purchase where you might feel cheated.</p>

    <p>Xbox Live is everywhere. Whether you own an iPhone, a Nintendo Switch, or an actual Xbox. Turns out, Microsoft has been fleshing out its platform of achievements, multiplayer, and more into hosts such as iOS, Android, Windows, and the like. Playing Minecraft? You’ll need a Microsoft account to connect to Xbox Live for that, no matter where you play. Opening up the platform to 3rd party developers to integrate within their games builds a reliance and exposes millions of more customers to Xbox, somewhat indirectly. This will continue, bearing fruit for Microsoft as more cross-platform games hook into Xbox Live. Their relevancy will continue despite what happens to their hardware and first party titles, and they can continue servicing customers in this way. But Microsoft doesn’t want to worry about their hardware, which is why Xbox, in its entirety, is coming everywhere too.</p>

    <img src="images/xbox/xcloud.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>With Project xCloud, Microsoft wants to bring the entire experience of an Xbox device to the cloud. No matter what device you own, you will have access to Xbox. Perhaps this is rolled into a Game Pass subscription, there will be a day where you can mount your phone onto an Xbox controller and play the latest AAA title, all processed online (with the advent of 5G, this should be easily feasible). Beyond just mobile devices, owning a Switch or a PC, or even a smart TV could grant you access to Xbox, provided Microsoft makes xCloud apps for as many platforms as it can (Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, whatever). When this day comes, the company will have realized its dream (one that took billions of dollars of investment into its Azure cloud division) of being a purely software and services provider that is inescapable. Vertical integration is Apple’s game, volume and mass exposure has always been Microsoft’s.</p>


    <p>In a world where Amazon, Google, Sony, and who knows who else are all working on game streaming services, there is only one company with the hardware, content deals and studio ownership, content distribution, and cloud backend ALL in place for a complete offering for gaming. Apple has failed to fully capitalize on the success of its billion iOS devices and thriving game ecosystem in the App Store, Sony seems content with its progress as of now, and the others all lack a meaningful presence in the industry. Gaming is the fastest growing entertainment industry there is, and Microsoft is poised to take over a big slice in the pie. History has proven repeatedly that the company often missteps its massive opportunities however, and the competition is never to be completely written off. But it seems that the software giant’s gaming ecosystem is finally coming together in a big way, with its strengths in value and accessibility to the customer, and all its bets on the cloud. </p>

    <button class="collapsible"><h2>Apple and a Case of Overlapping Devices</h2></button>
    <div class="content">

    <img src="images/applePost/steveSlide1.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>If you’re in the market for category flagship Apple product (an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook), chances are you’re about to purchase a device that shares many of the same hardware and software features as another Apple product. This makes sense, undoubtedly, as the products are part of an ecosystem with common features and are built by a company famously known for having teams that collaborate closely on all their projects. Yet I believe there is a convergence point that is slowly being reached, a point Apple and the industry as a whole is perhaps unknowingly working towards, where our devices become so saturated with capabilities, they begin encroaching on the feature sets of our other devices, and the only limitations on our owning of a simplified set of products is Apple’s insistence to selling an entire lineup that is perhaps confusingly complex. It is hard to blame a primarily hardware company for wanting to sell more… hardware, but in some ways the act of producing tens of SKUs and multiple screen sizes and different price points and configurations introduces complexity that an Apple of yesteryear, culturally, stood against.</p>
    <img src="images/applePost/steveSlide2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Despite Apple’s insistence that the merging of macOS and iOS is not happening, all logic points to this happening eventually. Apple’s track record of being opposed to ideas, only to go ahead and implement them (often in a better way, but not always) is testament to this. So is Project Marzipan, Apple’s massive undertaking to port iOS apps to the Mac. If this is not a true tell sign that there is some convergence happening, I’m not sure what is. A 13” touch screen device with a keyboard and a 13” device with a keyboard and mouse are too similar in the tasks they are meant to do, and the software they run (Safari, Office, a ton of Apple’s own apps, even Photoshop) for Apple to not be itching to have them run the same operating system. In a world where iPad apps run on a Mac, and a world where iPads are beginning to look like Frankenstein MacBooks, a detachable Mac with a touchscreen is far too intuitive of a move. There’s Macs out there right now in fact with little iOS flavors and ARM processors inside controlling the touchbar and Touch ID! Not even Apple’s marketing department has a good distinction between the kind of people who should be using a MacBook Air or an iPad Pro. Today, we know an iPad Pro is vastly more limited in comparison to a MacBook Air’s feature set, for a lot of people (maybe not most). But we also know that today is not an indicator of tomorrow. Just as Chromebooks were laughed at during their introduction, today they own the US education market and have become serious options for those who live their PC lives inside a web browser (read: most people). In no time will an iPad Pro have the advanced UI features and applications people are accustomed to from their PCs. At that time, should the Mac have not underwent a significant transformation already to avoid iPod-level fadeout post-iPhone, it will make little sense for Apple to have yearly feature updates and hardware refreshes for a legacy platform. </p>
    <img src="images/applePost/ipadvsmac.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>Concurrently selling 4 iPhone models, where the distinction perhaps is not as clear by name alone, is a different story of a different Apple. Worth noting, however, is the largest of these iPhones, iPhone XS Max, has a screen diagonal of 6.5”. That’s not too far off from the almost-defunct iPad Mini (7.9”), which Apple possibly will refresh soon. However, interestingly enough, the XS Max offers virtually no features or software goodies that take advantage of this massive display. Yeah you can turn the display sideways and see a list of your messages AND your messages simultaneously. Nice. That’s the differentiator between a 4” iPhone SE and the mini tablet of a phone that is the $1000+ XS Max. Owning one of these iPhones is akin to owning a small iPad (especially if you opt to get the LTE version). The app selection is the same, but limited (iPad apps take wonderful advantage of the large screen real estate, instead of just scaling up). True multitasking is nonexistent for artificial reasons (we have fanless processors clocking in faster than full blown Intel laptop processors and screens almost twice as big as the original iPhone, but a picture-in-picture mode is impossible?). In fact, beyond the camera system and screen sizes, I cannot think of a major differentiator between the iPad lineup and the iPhone lineup. The operating system is the same, but with limitations imposed on the iPhone for reasons beyond me (I know Apple has UI designers that can figure out how to do split-view on a XS Max). This leads me to wonder how Apple is poised to handle foldable smartphones, a natural and inevitable evolution of the iPhone. A folding XS Max would yield a diagonal of >8 inches and a lot more screen surface area. A trifold XS Max would approach regular iPad sized territory. In a world where a 4” iPhone has virtually no software distinction from a 6.5” one, how will a 9” iPhone fare against an 11” iPad? Surely the selling point of such a device would be its ability to transform into an iPad and take advantage of that screen real estate. Then what is the selling point of an iPad? Much like an iPad Pro is slowly encroaching on the Mac’s user base, the currently-lite edition of an iPad seems to be any of the new iPhones, which are set to evolve into devices that encroach on the iPad’s user base. When you have two dominant devices with such a similar feature set as a huge iPhone and an iPad Pro, which are you really selling and to whom? Do people really need all of those devices or is the single purpose device on the rise? </p>
    <img src="images/applePost/patent.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The story doesn’t end there, as Apple has a huge stake in something that might evolve to be their “next iPhone”. The wearables market. This goes way deeper than a little Watch that tracks your heartbeat and shows you texts you get from your phone. The Apple Watch is the single best example of a focused standalone device in Apple’s lineup where they seem to have a clear idea to justify its existence as something more than a little iPhone you strap to your wrist (with standalone LTE, it seems like that still is a strong vision Apple has for this product). This is Apple’s foray into health, and their investment into advanced sensors and tracking reflects their seriousness about this product. So much so, that I think the Apple Watch and AirPods are going to be a huge part of their future in consumer electronics. Specifically, their interest in developing augmented reality glasses shows their willingness to experiment with new computing ideas and paradigms. Where iPad, iPhone, and Mac are tried and tested, Apple is looking to wearables to develop a new series of experiences and use cases for the upcoming decades of the company. Hiring Google’s chief of AI is a telltale sign of their interest in furthering Siri into some sort of interaction model for a world without keyboards perhaps, where your AirPods are akin to the personal assistant from the movie Her, your Watch is your “on at all times” primary computing device for hailing Ubers and controlling your smart home, and your world is your interface thanks to augmented reality glasses. This is the kind of ambition that is absent from the largely matured smartphone and tablet/PC marketplace, where exciting things are still happening, but it’s more like confusion trying to settle down instead of revolution happening (that took place in the late 2000’s).</p>
    <img src="images/applePost/arkit.jpeg" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>So what do we have today? We have a watch that can play music, send texts, take phone calls and track a ton of biometrics for health. It is dying to be a standalone product, and one day it will be. We have a phone that can essentially do the same (minus the health tracking, which to be fair is a major distinguisher and a step in the right direction) but on a much larger screen, take astonishing photos, and has a large selection of apps (some of which are actually the full sized versions of the ones available on the Watch). We have a tablet that can essentially do the same (minus the astonishing photos part), but on a much larger screen, and has a large selection of apps (sound familiar?). We have a laptop that can essentially do the same, but on an even larger screen, and with a large set of apps, where many are legacy however and a lot of the new and influential ones do not exist. There are problems visible in this lineup that need to be fixed. When your products are so similar, yet so distinct, but on a path of convergence, you must look to their strong suites and do what differentiates them best to give them purpose. It is obvious, with ARkit, Apple is setting up an augmented reality future piggybacking off the success of its past (and present) with iOS. One that will have a new yet to be announced product at the centerpiece.  With Apple Watch, Apple must continue to build more health related features (as it did with ECG) and continue down its current trajectory of turning a highly advanced piece of tech into fashion, a strategy that has been part of Apple’s DNA forever. iPhone must evolve too, with a focus on photography (there is a reason the iPhone is the world’s most popular camera year after year) and hardware innovation from Apple Research (foldability isn’t some weird trend, it’s the future). The iPad must cement its place as a Pro consumer device for getting work done. This means converging the Mac line with the iPad line and engineering devices that bring the high quality touch experience (and don’t forget Apple Pencil, something that would be appreciated by millions of creatives using the Mac and some Bamboo device plugged into it) and beloved macOS feature set and productivity together into a beautiful product. Apple has a strong foundation in its loyal user base, hundreds of billions in cash, and world class people working for them. It remains to be seen whether they can produce the next revolution in consumer electronics with those indispensable resources. A company of such enormity rarely falls into irrelevance quickly, which is why the plethora of “Apple is doomed” articles that make their rounds regularly (often after reporting a drop in quarterly revenue that’s something like from 10 bazillion to 9.9 bazillion) should generally be shrugged off. But big, does not mean bulletproof.</p>

    <button class="collapsible"><h2>Exploring the Philips Wake-up Light</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1250.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The Philips Wake-up light is something of a retrofuturistic device, an alarm clock designed for the future by people living in an earlier era. The concept is simple, replicate a sunrise anywhere from 20-40 minutes before your alarm to wake you up naturally, with gentle sounds playing as the alarm. This post is not about the effectiveness that Philips claims for this clock in waking you up, it is instead a dive into the industrial design and user interaction model of this product. In a time when even Philips has seemingly moved on with its Hue line of bulbs, relegating “sunrise wake-up” to a feature meant to be toggled inside an app, how does the $140 Wake-up light stack up?</p>
    <img src="images/philipsClock/IMG_1252.JPG" width="50%" height="50%" class="centeredImg"/>
    <p>The Philips Wake-up light is a handsome product. The dualshot plastic body is more sophisticated than a basic matte or glossy solid color plastic finish and appears more apt to a device meant to be used in the home than a textured/patterned surface (a la Jawbone). It is complemented perfectly on the front face of the clock with the same dual-shot design. The whole device seems to be one contiguous body with only the ring of buttons acting as the unsightly seam (more on that later). Apparent in this photo another unsightly element of the product, the unusually long and wiry FM antenna. Perhaps a better design choice would’ve been to construct the white plastic band around the clock out of metal and use that as an antenna, but perhaps they had their reasons not to do so.</p>

    <p>On the back of the product, the infuriatingly placed speaker grill can be seen. For some reason unknown to me, companies continue producing devices with speakers that do not face their users. In doing so (especially depending on what may reside behind the device) the audio is muffled or lower than anticipated. Placing the speaker perhaps on the bottom front face of the clock would have been greatly appreciated, with laser drilled holes as opposed to the massive boombox-style grill we have now. This shot also gives a better look at how light plays with the dual shot plastic body, very well. The back is unfettered from buttons or switches, thankfully, and just houses a proprietary power plug (a fine decision, as the power input needed for this thing likely exceeds what a regular USB-C power source provides, and that market remains too fragmented to bother with).</p>

    <p>The power adapter is well designed in that the prongs were placed on the same axis as the adapter itself. Doing so saves a lot of space in the outlet once plugged in, and is a wildly appreciated design touch in a world where power adapters use one, but take the space of two (sometimes three on an outlet extender) outlets. Where a design choice falls short is the use of two strand wires adhered together instead of being encased in a cylindrical or fettuccine cable. For those unfamiliar, your phone charger, while appearing to be one cable, actually houses several wires inside. Same with your wired headphones (some Beats headphone cables resemble a fettuccine noodle, hence the name I use. This combats tangling). Cables have been this way for several years now, and Philips’ oversight in shipping a power adapter with strung together wires as such strikes me as another example of this product having one foot solidly planted in the past.</p>

    <p>I have a tumultuous relationship with the buttons on this device. But before that, just take notice at the two visible seams (one on the white plastic between the buttons, other below it on the transparent plastic). Take notice at the seemingly unnecessary perimeter venting as well (this device does not need that kind of airflow). I’ll let you formulate your opinions on those subjects. Now onto the buttons. First, facing this clock and using the buttons is impossible without muscle memory and plain old memory itself. Either you memorize the button layout and use the bumps on some of them to navigate your fingers around, or you get up and move your head around the perimeter of the clock, searching for buttons (very likely in the dark, where they lack even the most basic of illumination techniques such as glow in the dark radium). Unlike the other aspects of the clock, the buttons are very cheaply constructed, giving a very hollow click when pressed and wobbling around in place. Unfortunately, instead of consolidating all input in one place, there are more buttons (this time, touch-sensitive) on the front face of the clock (where they all should belong actually).</p>

    <p>A cool design touch is the illumination of the buttons as your finger approaches them. This is made possible I’m guessing by cranking the capacitive sensitivity of these buttons up to an 11. Unfortunately, this is also made useless as the button titles are not illuminated. Remembering which button is “menu” and which is “select” is not a task I expect to do on my $140 alarm clock. Another example of where user interaction falls short is having to hit the “+” button 30 times to set my alarm to 8:30 AM. Perhaps buttons are not the best mode of input for a device such as this. Also visible in this photo is the digital clockface, which would be fine were it colored white and the time was the only thing it was displaying.</p>

    <p>However, it is an ominously glowing red that in a dark room at night bleeds beyond the lit up portions of the clock face. Instead of being a potentially cool-looking matrix LED setup, the display has precut shapes for the icons that strongly resemble the hunky black plastic bedside alarm clocks from the 90s. The LEDs used to illuminate the buttons below are for some reason a distinct color from the clock face. A better-suited display would’ve been a front-lit, touchscreen e-ink panel. Such a display would remove pretty much all non-essential buttons from the actual housing of the device, add more interaction models (such as sliders for volume or alarm time), and look much more elegant (a glowing monochromatic display versus an 80s themed seven segment display, you decide). The quality of the image I embedded reflects my displeasure with such aspects of this product.</p>

    <p>Again, the product is handsome indeed. At first look it certainly does not look like any alarm clock that precedes it, resembling the Sun itself. I’m sure that was the motif. The plastic acts as a wonderful diffuser, with no semblance of bright spots or light leaks from the main bulb itself. Some things Philips wholeheartedly nails, and the execution of the light is extraordinary, transitioning between, red, orange, and finally a warm white as smoothly as possible.</p>

    <p>In the end, the Philips Wake-up light is what it is. It’s what you get when a company focused primarily on lighting decides to make an all-in-one consumer electronics product. This is a product that does not know daylight savings time exists, and when unplugged forgets what time it is. This is not a product born out of competitive Silicon Valley tech product culture, and there is no Steve Jobsian dictatorial figure at the head of it all shelving products and disbanding teams because of one small detail. Today, the clock seems to have been discontinued in all sense of the word except production and distribution. Years have gone by with no major updates to the line, and with Philips aggressively pushing their Hue lights, sunrise wake-up has been rolled into a bullet point feature rather than a headliner. The whole saga reflects the ongoing assault on specific-use consumer technology. In a world of multifunction devices, Philips had access to a specialized technology not yet completely commercialized as an iPhone app. This is what has come out of it. The reason the Kindle has been able to survive is impeccable engineering, innovation, promotion, and support. Opting instead to stagnate their product and selling it at full price years later, Philips has done a disservice and dished an insult by forcing users to purchase Hue bulbs, a Hue bridge, and use a mobile app to have their upgraded experience of a wake-up light when a single self-contained product was serviceable in the past. Perhaps we are doomed for this complexity that is shrouded in the false veil of simplicity, where our product ecosystems merge and complicate our lives, while companies eager to sell us this vision of the future promise the exact opposite.</p>
    
    <p><h2>Update:</h2>Sitting around my room with nothing better to do and a spare USB LED lamp, I decided to scrap together my own version of the wakeup light. Now, this takes into account absolutely none of the criticism from above, as this was a project with essentially 0 budget and completed in roughly an hour and a half. It is more of a fun little experiment that replicates the basic functionality of the alarm clock that the multibillion dollar Philips corporation came up with, and you can build one too with a microcontroller such as an Arduino, a transistor, and a USB powered lamp. Below is what it looks like.</p>
